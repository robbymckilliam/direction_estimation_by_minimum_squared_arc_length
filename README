Latex and simulation scripts for the paper:

R. G. McKilliam, B. G. Quinn, and I. V. L. Clarkson. Direction estimation by minimum squared arc length. IEEE Trans. Sig. Process., 60(5):2115-2124, May 2012.

Data from the simulations already exists in this repository.  If you are using bash then

bash build.sh

will build the pdf using this data.  The pdf is called papersm.pdf.  The code/ directory contains the source code.

bash runsim.sh

will run the simulations and regenerate data for the paper.  You need a working java jvm and also Scala 2.10.x or higher installed.  Depending on your machine this might take a while.  Open up the bash script and work backwards to get at the code.
